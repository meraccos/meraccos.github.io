        Here I challenge you to solve some interesting math and physics related
        problems that I have encountered, or thought of throughtout years. Note
        that while selecting the problems, I have focused more on how
        interesting the problem is and how enjoyable the solution process is,
        rather than the hardness of them.

          Imagine two identical objects with heat capacity \(C\) and
          temperatures \(T_1\) and \(T_2\). If we were to build an engine out of

          A ballistic missile is launched from the north pole, the target is at
          the latitude \(\phi\). To have the minimal launch velocity of the
          missile, at which angle (with respect to the horizon) do we need to

          Two small, identical particles have opposing charges of magnitude
          \(q\). They are separated by a distance \(L\) and left free. Find the
