        <p>
          I am a first year Master's student of Mechanical Engineering at Ulsan
          National Institute of Science and Engineering (UNIST). I have got my
          Bachelor's Degree on Mechanical Engineering and Computer Science &
          Engineering in UNIST.
        </p>
        <p>
          Currently, I am working in Autonomous Systems Laboratory (ASL) under
          the supervision of Professor Hyondong Oh. I have previously worked in
          Innovative Thermodynamics Laboratory (ITEL) with Professor Jaeson
          Lee's supervision.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have also participated in several national and international Physics
          Olympiads and been awarded with one Bronze, one Silver, and one Gold
          medals in the span of 2 years.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am currently working on reinforcement learning and its applications
          on robot autonomy. I am interested in a diverse variety of topics, so
          feel free to reach out to discuss projects!
